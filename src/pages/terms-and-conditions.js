No guarantee. Neither the Company nor its affiliates owns or controls any of the underlying software through which blockchain networks are formed and with which any Tokens are created and transacted. Neither the Company nor its affiliates makes any guarantee of functionality, security, or availability of such software and networks.<br />
<br />

The blockchain technology underlying Tokens is subject to change at any time, including changes in operating rules (commonly referred to as "forks"), and blockchain networks may go offline as a result of bugs, hard forks, or a number of other unforeseeable reasons. Such changes may materially and adversely affect the value or function of the Tokens in your Account. You agree that you are fully responsible for monitoring such changes and agree to bear all risks arising therefrom or relating thereto.<br />
<br />
Cyber-attacks. In the event of a cyberattack on the Platform, App, Site, or any other component of the Services, your Account and the Tokens therein may be adversely affected. Neither the Company nor its affiliates makes any guarantee that it may foresee, prevent, mitigate, or take corrective action in the event of such attack.<br />
<br />
Suspension/Discontinuation of Support/Withdrawal.

The Company will provide you with an opportunity to withdraw such Tokens if feasible. Resolutions concerning deposits, withdrawals, and User balances for an attacked Token will be determined on a case-by-case basis by the Company in its sole discretion. The Company makes no representations or warranties with respect to the security of the Platform, and shall not liable for any lost value or stolen property, regardless of whether the Company was negligent in providing the proper security.<br />
<br />

The Company hereby disclaims all responsibility for any loss or damage arising from or relating to your use of any Services (including, but not limited to, risk of losses due to trading or due to factors beyond its control regarding the viability of any specific blockchain network) or your failure to understand the risks involved in Token use generally or your use of our Services.

<br />
(b) Prevailing rate<br />
<br />
While the Company uses commercially reasonable methods to provide exchange rate information to you through our Services, such information may differ from prevailing exchange rates made available by third parties. Moreover, the actual market rate at the time of your trade may be different from the indicated prevailing rate depending on the velocity of trading in the Tokens involved in your trade. The Company hereby disclaims all responsibility for any loss or damage arising from or relating to price fluctuations, latencies, or differences in actual versus indicated prevailing rates.<br />
<br />
(c) Transaction failure; Terms of Online Deposit<br />
<br />

You agree and consent that the Company shall not be responsible for notifying you of a transaction failure.<br />
<br />
The Company may refuse to execute a trade or impose trade amount limits or restrictions at any time, without prior notice, and in its sole discretion.

The Company may correct, reverse, or cancel any trade impacted by an error in processing your trading instructions or otherwise. Your remedy in the event of an error will be limited.

(e) Illiquidity<br />
<br />
You may find it difficult or impossible to liquidate a position. This can occur if there is insufficient liquidity in the market. Placing contingent orders, such as "stop-loss" or "stop-limit" orders, will not necessarily limit your losses to the intended amounts, because it may be impossible to execute such orders due to market conditions. Factors, including but not limited to regulatory scrutiny, market manipulation or unexplainable price volatility can all affect market liquidity for a particular Token<br />
<br />
(f) Default and Liquidation<br />
<br />
You agree to maintain a sufficient number of Tokens in your Account(s) at all times to meet the Company’s minimum balance requirements, as such requirements may be modified from time to time at the Company’s sole discretion. If the value of the assets in your Account falls below the minimum balance requirement, or if your Account appears to be in danger of defaulting on a loan, the Company may seize and liquidate any or all of your positions and assets on any balance in your Account in order to settle your debt to other Users. If, after your positions and assets are liquidated, your Account still contains insufficient Tokens to settle your debts to other Users, you are solely responsible for any additional Tokens owed.<br />
<br />
(g) No trading advice.<br />
<br />
If at any point the Company or its representatives or affiliates provide trading recommendations, market commentary, or any other information, you acknowledge and agree that no such communications do not constitute trading advice.

<br />

<br />
You acknowledge and agree that the Company’s recordkeeping and customer verification procedures may be, without prior notice, subject to change at any time as required by applicable regulations or state of the art practices.<br />
<br />

In the event such disclosure is compelled, you agree that the Company may disclose information regarding your Accounts. While the Company will endeavor to, where commercially reasonable, give you prior notice of such disclosure, the Company makes no guarantees that such prior notice will be made.<br />
<br />
You acknowledge and agree that the Company does not represent or warrant, whether explicitly or implicitly, the timely or successful deposit or withdrawal of any legal currency in your Account.
